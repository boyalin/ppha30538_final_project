CHICAGO (CBS) — Two shootings happened within an hour of each other overnight on Interstate 57, Illinois State Police said.
The first shooting happened just before 1:30 a.m. in the northbound lanes at I-94, where troopers responded to a report of an expressway shooting.
The victim's vehicle was hit by gunfire. No one was hurt.
While troopers were investigating that shooting, another also occurred in the northbound lanes just after 2 a.m. at Halsted.
State police said someone in the offending vehicle fired shots at another vehicle before crashing and rolling over. All occupants of the offending vehicle left the scene.
No injuries were reported in that incident.
All lanes reopened just before 5 a.m.
Investigation into both shootings remains ongoing.
Earlier this week, a man was charged with murder in a deadly road rage shooting on I-80 near New Lenox.
Phillip   Rogers, 45, is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon in the shooting death of 30-year-old Lenier Clayton.
Clayton's family went to Will County Court on Wednesday to face the accused gunman.
Clayton's sister, Mia, said the details they learned are disturbing.
"We knew he had been shot multiple times. We didn't know how many times. So finding out that he shot at him 11 times, that nine of him hit him, and that most of them were in his back, it's sickening. There was no reason for it," she said.
Illinois State Police said there have been 79 shootings on Chicago area expressways so far this year, down from last year, when there were 129 expressway shootings in all of 2023.
Of this year's expressway shootings, 19 were on the Dan Ryan Expressway, 15 were on the Bishop Ford Freeway, 10 were on the Stevenson Expressway, 7 were on Interstate 57, and 2 were on Interstate 80.

CHICAGO (CBS) -- A 5-year-old boy was killed, a 2-year-old boy was critically injured, and two men were seriously hurt in a head-on crash Tuesday evening in north suburban Beach Park.
Lake County Sheriff's officials said deputies responded to a crash around 5 p.m. on Green Bay Road, just north of Hart Street in Beach Park, where a Chevrolet Malibu and a GMC Sierra had collided.
Investigators determined the driver of the Malibu was headed south on Green Bay Road, and illegally passing other vehicles by driving in the northbound lanes, when he crashed head-on with the oncoming Sierra.
The driver of the Chevrolet, a 24-year-old man from Waukegan, was holding his 2-year-old son in his lap while he was driving. The boy was critically injured, and the father was seriously injured.
The father told sheriff's deputies no one else was in the Chevrolet, but deputies later found his 5-year-old son under debris behind the back seat. The 5-year-old was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
The Lake County Coroner's Office identified the 5-year-old as Sy'mere McKnight, of Zion. An autopsy determined he died of blunt force injuries from the crash.
Sheriff's officials said it was unclear why the father didn't tell deputies that Sy'mere was in the car. Neither of the children was properly secured in a child safety seat at the time of the crash.
The driver of the GMC was seriously injured, and was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Sheriff's officials said the crash remained under investigation Wednesday morning, and charges were pending.

AURORA, Ill. (CBS) — A woman was charged in a multi-car crash that left a man dead in Aurora, Illinois, earlier this year.
Alisa Gutierrez, 20, from Aurora, was charged with two counts of reckless homicide, aggravated street racing, two counts of reckless driving, speeding over 35 miles over the speed limit, two counts of improper lane usage, following too closely, failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident, and speeding.
Aurora police said around 8:40 p.m. on July 24, officers and fire personnel responded to the crash near East New York Street and North Eola Road.
Investigators determined that Gutierrez was driving a Dodge Challenger westbound on East New York Street. She was racing a motorcycle at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour when she suddenly changed into the right turn lane toward North Eola Road, struck a curb, and lost control. The vehicle became airborne and collided with three cars stopped at a red light before rolling over multiple times.
One of the drivers, Gerardo Cuatzo, 45, from Aurora, died at the scene. Two other people were also hurt.
A warrant for Gutierrez's arrest was issued on Nov. 11, and she was taken into custody on Nov. 20.
"Driving is a privilege, not a right," DuPage County State's Attorney Bob Berlin said. "The allegations that Ms. Gutierrez was traveling in excess of 100 miles per hour just seconds before crashing her car into several vehicles, killing Gerardo Cuatzo, are shocking. I offer my sincere condolences to Gerardo's family and friends. Losing someone suddenly can be devastating to a family and I wish them strength as they continue their lives without the love and support Gerardo once provided."
She was released after a pretrial hearing and is scheduled to appear back in court on Dec. 18.

Title: 1 killed, 13 injured when 2 cars, CTA bus crash in Washington Park neighborhood

Full Article:
CHICAGO (CBS) -- One person was killed and 13 other people were injured Wednesday evening when a stolen car slammed into another car and a CTA bus in the Washington Park neighborhood.
The crash was preceded by a possible police pursuit, though police are not using the word "chase" to describe what happened.
The crash happened around 7 p.m. at 60th and State streets. The Chicago Transit Authority said a No. 59 59th/61st Street bus was heading south on State Street approaching 60th Street when the two cars collided—and then both hit the bus.
Police said the suspects behind the deadly crash were already speeding when officers spotted them veering into oncoming traffic near 68th and State streets.
Police said officers "followed" the car a mile north to 60th and State streets, where it hit another car and a CTA bus.
The Chicago Fire Department called an EMS Plan 2, which sends 10 ambulances to the scene.
Police said the car responsible for the crash had been reported stolen. Four guns were found inside.
The driver of the first car that was hit by the stolen vehicle was rushed to the hospital, where they later died. Three people who were in the stolen car were taken to area hospitals in serious-to-critical condition.
Ten others who were on the CTA bus were taken to area hospitals in good condition.
The Fire Department showed photos of a white Jeep Cherokee that was completely demolished in the front and another car that was totaled beyond recognition.
Both the No. 59 bus and the No. 29 State Street bus were rerouted for some time after the crash.
"The consequences can be catastrophic to people who just happen to be on the same road, who are on an adjoining sidewalk, or even—as we saw in this case—on a bus," said David Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh.
Harris, a policing expert, said the fact that four guns were recovered from the car that turned out to be stolen is significant in the decision to follow the vehicle. But traffic offenses and theft of a car alone aren't enough, according to Chicago Police Department policy.
"The people or person in the fleeing car present some real danger," Harris said. "They have to be wanted for a dangerous crime."
Police radio traffic does not shed any light on the moments right before the crash when police started following the car.
Harris said Chicago is one of many cities nationwide to recently add caveats to its pursuit policies.
Last year, the Community Commission on Public Safety and Accountability raised concerns that restrictions allow offenders to get away—and contributed heavily to a citywide surge in robberies.
"Yes, we don't want bad guys to flee from the police, but at the cost of civilian lives? Not as clear," Harris said, "and that's what we're trying to come to grips with."
CPD's vehicle pursuit policy was revised in 2020 after a crash involving police killed a woman in Lakeview. The CPD said it continues to investigate the incident in Washington Park Wednesday night.

CHICAGO (CBS) -- A teenage driver crashed into a semi-trailer truck Tuesday morning in northwest suburban Arlington Heights, after fleeing a traffic stop in neighboring Prospect Heights.
Prospect Heights police said, shortly before 10:30 a.m., an officer in a marked squad car spotted a gray 4-door Lexus driving 56 mph in a 30 mph speed zone while headed west on Willow Road near Linden Road North.
When the officer activated the lights on his squad car and made a U-turn to try to pull the driver over, the Lexus sped off, and headed north on Rand Road from Willow Road.
Police said the officer determined he could not safely catch up to the fleeing Lexus, and did not chase the vehicle, but alerted dispatchers of the car's last known location.
A short time later, dispatchers advised Prospect Heights police of a crash involving the same Lexus and a semi-trailer truck in Arlington Heights, at Palatine and Rand roads.
Witnesses said the driver of the Lexus was speeding and driving recklessly before hitting the back of the truck. The Lexus ended up going through the undercarriage of the semi, and was severely damaged.
"I saw the small car trying to stop, but he couldn't stop on time for the red light. So he was trying to turn, and while it was green for the other lanes to pass, there was a truck passing by, and the guy started going into the lane where the truck was driving, and the truck drove right over him," Nada Daud said.
The diver of the Lexus, a 19-year-old man, was taken to Northwest Community Hospital to be treated for minor injuries. He is facing multiple traffic-related charges.
The driver of the semi was not hurt.

CHICAGO (CBS) — A second Illinois State Police trooper was hurt this week after a crash on the Bishop Ford Freeway.
State police said around 10 p.m. on Tuesday, the trooper was stopped on the left shoulder of the I-94 southbound at the Cottage Grove accident investigation site with its emergency lights activated. That's when an Infiniti sedan was attempting to change lanes into the left lane when it lost control, striking another vehicle and then the squad car.
The trooper was taken to a hospital with injuries, ISP said.
The Infiniti driver, Shylyn J. Richmond, 25, of Lansing, Illinois, was charged with aggravated Scott's Law violation and issued citations for driving under the influence, driving while license revoked, driving too fast for conditions, and multiple other Illinois vehicle code violations.
It's the second Scott's Law-related crash to have occurred in Chicago this week.
On Monday morning, another ISP trooper was seriously hurt after being hit by a car while responding to a crash on I-57. The driver in that crash also faces charges, including violating Scott's Law, and was issued citations.
According to state police, ISP has suffered 22 Move Over Law-related crashes statewide, with 11 troopers injured so far this year.
Scott's Law requires all drivers to move over when approaching an emergency vehicle or any vehicle with its emergency or hazard lights activated.

CHICAGO (CBS) -- Two teenagers were arrested after a stolen car plowed into a convenience store early Sunday in the Englewood neighborhood.
A police source said a pursuit of that stolen car was underway before the boys – both 15 years old – crashed their car into the front of a store near 75th Street and Vincennes Avenue just after midnight.
The entire car ended up inside Aladdin's Food convenience store. Both Chicago police officers and Illinois State Police were seen outside the store.
The crash left debris all over the street, and a streetlight was knocked down. Police led the two boys away in handcuffs after the crash.
Anthony Washington said he lives a block away from the convenience store, and came out before police arrived.
"I just heard a big boom," he said. "I left. I was scared, because I thought somebody was really, really hurt. So I panicked and I left, but I came back down here like about 12:30. I guess the ambulance had got the people who was in there or they got caught by the police."
Hours after the crash, the car remained inside the store. An officer on scene said the car cannot be removed until a person from the city's Department of Buildings can come out and inspect.
Police dispatch radio transmissions indicated that there appeared to be structural damage to the building.
One teen was charged with felony possession of a stolen vehicle. The other was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass to a vehicle.
Neither of the teens was injured, but they were taken to a local hospital as a precaution.

They said they had all been together Friday night as part of a truck club, driving around the city for about 30 minutes before stopping nearby to eat. But, they say, the sisters and a boyfriend left early in one car, and others from their group left in a second vehicle.
That's when they say someone in an unlicensed red or burgundy tow truck started harassing them around Roosevelt and Union, intentionally running into their cars while they were on the road.
They say the friends sped up to get away. During the chaos, the sisters' vehicle lost control, careened across the street, and slammed into a wall, bringing down a light pole.
Chicago police say the tow truck driver backed into an SUV, causing it to strike the victims' vehicle, which then lost control and struck a wall. The three victims inside were ejected from the vehicle.
Friends of the victims also say the police have video of the incident, which they are using to try to find the driver.
All were taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
A 21-year-old woman suffered a head injury and was hospitalized in critical condition but died a short time later.
Her 20-year-old sister and a 19-year-old boyfriend also suffered head injuries and were in critical condition.
"It's devastating," said neighbor Matthew Bryja. "It is a very busy road. People drive fast. Especially along here."
The SUV driver remained on the scene and was cooperating with police. The unknown tow truck driver fled the scene.
The Major Accident Investigation Unit is investigating.

ANTIOCH, Ill. (CBS) — A woman is critically injured, and a motorcyclist is facing felony charges after a crash near Antioch, Illinois, Saturday evening.
According to the Lake County Sheriff's Office, deputies responded to the crash scene near Route 59 and Diemer Street around 8:30 p.m. There, they found an unconscious and unresponsive woman on the road near a 1998 Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The woman, who was a passenger on the motorcycle, was hospitalized with critical, life-threatening injuries.
Officials say the motorcycle driver, 51-year-old Gregory Shaer of Lake Villa, told deputies he was heading south on Route 59 and swerved to avoid hitting a vehicle that turned in front of him. He did not suffer significant injuries.
Deputies say a 33-year-old Antioch woman told them she was heading north on Route 59 in her GMC Acadia when she was sideswiped by the motorcycle, which was heading south. She said Shaer swerved into her lane.
Officials say evidence located at the scene matches the woman's account of the incident, and Shaer showed signs of alcohol impairment. He was arrested but refused to provide breath, blood, or a urine sample. A Lake County judge approved a search warrant, and Shaer was taken to a local hospital to provide the samples.
Shaer is charged with aggravated DUI resulting in great bodily harm, which is a felony. He is also charged with DUI and driving in the wrong lane of traffic.
He was being held in the Lake County Jail and was scheduled to make his first court appearance on Sunday morning.

CHICAGO (CBS) — An Illinois State Police trooper was hurt after their squad car was struck on the Bishop Ford Freeway early Saturday morning.
It happened around 2:20 a.m. on southbound I-94 near 111th Street.
State police said the trooper's marked squad car was parked in the first lane with emergency lights activated while responding to a previous traffic crash. The trooper was inside of the squad car when it was struck in the rear by an Audi.
The trooper was taken to an area hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
The driver of the Audi, Samuel Oatis III, 47, from Dolton, Illinois, and his passenger were also taken to an area hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
Oatis was cited for not following the Move Over Law, which requires drivers to yield to stationary emergency vehicles, following too closely, and failing to reduce speed to avoid an accident.
So far this year, there have been 17 Move Over Law-related crashes, with eight troopers injured as a result.
For a first offense, violators face a fine of no less than $250 and no more than $10,000. If the violation results in injury to another person, the violator's driver's license will be suspended for a mandatory period of six months to two years.

Title: Mother relieved after charges are upgraded in crash that left young Chicago woman, friend dead

Full Article:
CHICAGO (CBS) -- A mother remains in a tenacious fight for justice almost 10 months after losing her daughter in a crash on DuSable Lake Shore Drive, for which charges against the driver have now been upgraded.
Back in March, Sandy Colon funded eye-catching billboards herself reading, "Please think, drive safely."
Her daughter Jaida Victoria Rosado Colon, 24, was one of two people killed in a crash on DuSable Lake Shore Drive at 31st Street on Oct. 31 of last year. Coming up on 10 months later, the sounds and sight of summer are present on a baseball diamond in Humboldt Park where she played softball—but there's a void too.
"She loved softball," said Sandy Colon. "She grew up in the Humboldt Park community."
Colon puts her daughter's picture up every Sunday during the softball season—in just one way she makes sure Jaida is remembered.
That Monday evening last fall, another vehicle headed south on the Drive at 31st Street cut off and crashed into the car in which Jaida was riding as a passenger. Police said the other driver was in the far left lane and suddenly crossed all lanes to make the 31st Street exit.
"He hit the passenger side of my daughter's car," said Colon. "They lost control, hit a tree, and lost their lives."
The car burst into flames. Jaida was killed along with her friend, Jalean Ewing-Gibbs, also 24, who was driving. Two 21-year-old sisters in the car with them survived—but Colon said one was left paralyzed.
For nearly a year, Sandy Colon kept pressing to get the driver—who stayed on the scene—to be subjected to more serious charges. Bradley Hamel originally faced only a traffic citation.
"In the blink of an eye, my baby's life was taken away," said Sandy Colon.
Yet this week, the Cook County State's Attorney's office upgraded charges. Hamel now faces two felony counts of aggravated reckless driving causing bodily harm, and two felony counts of reckless homicide.
"It definitely brought some form of peace," said Sandy Colon. "It's accountability. It's definitely heading towards the right direction."
Earlier this year, Colon purchased billboards insisting on keeping daughter's case in everyone's face.
"My pain is never going to go away," said Colon. "I'm learning how to deal with the emotional rollercoaster."
While the day is difficult for Jaida's mom, next month will be even harder. On Sept. 11, Hamel will appear in court on the new felony charges.
Colon said she is determined to be in court for every hearing.
"I hope that he thinks about what he did. it was my 24-year-old daughter's life. It was Gibby's 24-year-old life. It was a 21-year-old girl that's now paralyzed; her twin sister emotionally traumatized," she said. "He destroyed dozens of lives. I need him to understand that."
It was not clear what made Hamel exit the Drive so quickly that night. But on a summer night 10 months later, Jaida's mother hoped her daughter's image would help save the next person on the road.
"Having a license is a great responsibility," Colon said. "Sometimes people don't take that into consideration."

HAMMOND, Ind. (CBS) -- A Chicago family has been searching for answers and accountability after a man was struck and killed by a car on the Indiana Toll Road (I-90) last week.
Ronald Sterling, a longtime Chicago Transit Authority bus driver, was killed in a crash on the westbound lanes of the toll road this past Thursday morning. His family still has questions about what happened.
"We are trying to put it together," said niece Melinda Sanders. "We are trying to make it make sense."
Sterling was the heartbeat of his family. He died just days before his 75th birthday.
"His birthday is in two days, and instead of us planning his 75th birthday, we got to plan a funeral," said daughter Latasha Sterling. "My daddy didn't deserve that."
Indiana State Police said Sterling was traveling west on the toll road, west of Cline Avenue, when he crashed into the center concrete barrier wall.
The impact was so strong that Sterling's Honda spun around to face north. Sterling got out of his car, at which point Indiana State Police said his wrecked car was struck by the driver of a sport-utility vehicle.
Sterling died on scene.
"I'm hurt. I'm mad. I'm confused," said Latasha Sterling. "I want to know what happened. We're not getting no answers."
Indiana State Police said a 20-year-old from Oak Park was behind the wheel of the SUV that hit and killed Sterling. That driver was treated and released from a hospital for his injuries.
"He needs to be accountable for taking a life," Sanders said.
CBS News Chicago is not identifying the young man from Oak Park, as he has not been charged with a crime.
"We want justice," Sanders said. "My uncle was not a roadkill. He had a family that loved him unconditionally."
Indiana State Police said the 20-year-old driver's toxicology results are still pending, and it could be weeks before the crash reconstruction is completed. All that information will then be handed to the Lake County, Indiana prosecutor, who will determine if charges are warranted.

CHICAGO (CBS) — An 18-year-old man has died after crashing his car into a CTA bus on Chicago's Southwest Side early Saturday morning. The bus ended up plowing into a storefront, and three other people were also injured.
The crash happened around 4 a.m. in the 4000 block of West 26th Street in the Little Village neighborhood.
The façade and part of the roof collapsed into a pile of bricks below a bus-sized hole in the building.
Surveillance video shows the intersection was quiet until the collision. Sparks fly as the car slides sideways, and the CTA bus careens into the building.
Amparo Galan said she was on the bus on her way to work. She had just closed her eyes for a moment, and suddenly, she felt herself thrown from her seat.
Chicago Police say the 18-year-old driver of a white sedan ran a red light at 26th Street and Pulaski Road and struck the bus.
A 21-year-old woman was in the passenger seat.
All four occupants of the car and bus were taken to hospitals.
Ampara said she hurt her ribs and hip as the bus slammed into an empty storefront next to a check cashing service.
The white sedan was torn apart.
Chicago Police say the two in the car and the two people on the bus, including the driver, were taken by ambulance to Mt. Sinai and St. Anthony hospitals.
Police say the driver of the sedan was taken to St. Anthony Hospital but did not survive. The others are expected to recover.
Contractors on site say there is a mess to clean up, but the building can be saved.
The name of the 18-year-old driver who died had not been released on Saturday evening.
Police said no citations were issued.

CHICAGO (CBS) -- A woman has been charged with drunk driving and reckless homicide after a wrong-way crash that killed a beloved fitness coach on the Kennedy Expressway earlier this week.
Illinois State Police said 21-year-old Jakyla Hester was driving under the influence of alcohol and driving without a license around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, when she started heading south in the northbound lanes of Interstate 90 near Cumberland and hit a 2012 Honda sedan.
The driver of the Honda, 27-year-old Quinn Fraboni, died at the scene.
Hester was taken to a local hospital with injuries after the crash. She has been charged with one felony count of reckless homicide and two felony counts of aggravated DUI. She was also cited for driving without a license, driving without insurance, disobeying a traffic control device, driving the wrong way on a divided highway, and driving under the influence of alcohol.
She was scheduled to appear for a detention hearing on Friday.
Fraboni's death left his colleagues and clients at Flexx Personal Training, where he worked as a coach, shattered.
Flexx owner Connor Flahive said news of Fraboni's death was "surreal."
Fraboni started at Flexx as a client before becoming a standout fitness coach.
"The way that he was able to connect with people and be a part of their lives and no matter what they were going through, what he was going through," said Flahive. "It was like, you walk through that door, and it was high-five [with a] smile on his face."
The Flexx team put training sessions on pause as they tried to cope with the loss. Coaches said they now have one priority.
"Number one thing is that Quinn will be like just ingrained in what we do moving forward," Flahive said.
